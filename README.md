# Brute

A simple and lightweight Entity Component System library for writing games with Clojure.

The aim of this project was to use basic Clojure building blocks to form an ECS architecture.

- Entities are UUIDs.
- The Component type system can be easily extended through a multimethod `get-component-type`.
- Components can therefore be defrecords, deftypes, maps or really anything you choose, really.
- Systems are simply references to functions of the format `(fn [delta])`.
